					<td> Our savoury chana masala served between two baras. Served with a side of mango chutney, chadon beni, and tamarind
						sauce.  A morning delight that is a favourite on the sister islands.

						2/$5</td>
					<td> A fried fillet of ethically sourced island shark served in a specialty region bread refered to by Trinis as Frybake.
						Piled high with coleslaw, pineapple, and topped with a loacal sauce called grean seasoning. A taste of the beach
						famous around Trinidad's northern beaches.
						<br/>
						
						$12</td>
					<td> An island classic served with indian flatbread called roti. A thick stew made of chickpeas, and onions cooked low
						and slow in a richly spiced gravy. A perfect meal after a long day at town or in the bush.

					<th> Stew Chicken </th>
					<th> Curried Crab </th>
					<th> Cascadu and Cassava </th>
				<tr>
				<tr>
					<td> Sweet, sour, and succulent! Large peices of marinated chicken and a proprietary mix of beans slowly simmered in a 
						broth of peppers, spices, and island sugar. An island favourite. Served with a side of fresh jasmine rice and 
						salad. 
						<br/>
						
						$15</td>
					<td> Island crabs prepared fresh this morning. Enjoy the sweet flavour and unqie flaky texture of these shellfish 
						caught just off the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. A menu item lauded by our owner as one of his favourites
						growing up. Served alongside dumpling with extra gravy!
						<br/>
						
						$18</td>
					<td> Creamy cassava and fried plantains are served with this native favourite. The cascasdu fish has a unique
						flavour that is enhanced by currying it with a belly stuffed with native herbs. A true island delicacy.
						<br/>
						
						$20</td>
